Release 1.0 - March 17 2005

first release of ufdbGuard.
Version 1.0 does 28,000 verifications/sec.


Release 1.1 - May 2 2005

ufdbGuard now also supports databases that are based upon URLs.
So now it supports
1) basic domain names (e.g. www.google.com)
2) full URLs          (e.g. www.africaonline.com/news/index.htm)  (NEW)
ufdbGenTable has an extra option (-u) to support this.

ufdbGuard has a test mode that logs which URLs can be blocked but always
sends a 'this URL is allowed' message to squid so nothing is blocked to
users in test mode.  Use the -T option.

The release procedure had a flaw to include a binary executable in the source
distribution.  The executable is not included any more.

ufdbGenTable assumed in 1.0 that all input files had lowercase domains/urls.
Now it converts the input to lowercase to catch mistakes in the input files.

There was still a dependency on db.h in sg.y and sgDiv.c that was removed.

Fix a bug in sg.y where 1 byte memory was malloced too short for a string
(this bug is from squidguard 1.2.0 sg.y line 965)

Fix a bug where ufdbGuard crashed on URLs that are longer than 512 bytes.

Always log 
1) the number of requests that were processed
2) the CPU times used to initialize and process all requests.

Include the test directory in the release.
This also prevents an error in the configure script.

Fix buffer overflow error for input lines.
Fix NULL pointer error in SgLogRequest().

Support to build squidGuard and ufdbGuard from the same source has been dropped.

Fix bug in URL parser where the port number was not stripped from the URL,
i.e. chat.terra.com.br:3876/xxx was not categorised as "chat".


Release 1.2  -  July 24 2005

various optimisations in parseLine()

The log file is rotated when the size exceeds 512 MB.
A maximum of 10 log files are used.

version 1.1 always logged the REDIRECTs in the log file.
In version 1.2 the default is not to log them.
Implemented -r option to log REDIRECTs.

Encryption of tables implemented.
All tools use the 1.2 table format that has encrypted data (the header is plain text).

Compression of databases using bzip2 is implemented.

Fix old-style perl in ufdbGuard.cgi

The performance is now about 25,000 URL verifications/sec.


Release 1.3  - September 21 2005

Use larger I/O buffer to increase speed of generating a .ufdb table
ufdbGenTable has new -q option to suppress warnings

Make code of ufdbguard thread-safe.

A new multithreaded ufdbguardd daemon is born.
The daemon has only one copy of the database in memory and 
16-64 worker threads.
To perform a URL verification using the ufdbguardd daemon, the
new lightweight program ufdbgclient can be used by squid as a 
lightweight redirector.

Warning: the ufdbguardd has a default number of 16 URL verification threads.
Use the -w option to increase the number of threads.
!!! Do *not* use more redirectors in squid than threads in the daemon.

An API has been developed to use ufdbGuard code linked with 
3rd party software (see src/api/apitest.c).

fixed memory leak at reload of config file.

Support processor affinity for the multithreaded daemon on Linux with
a line like "cpus 2,3" in the configuration file.
This enhances CPU cache efficiency and is recommended on all
real multi-CPU machines.  Do not use it on a single hyperthreaded CPU.


Release 1.4  - November 29 2005

new functionality:
re-introduced support for usernames and userlist in ACLs

fixes:
fixed database reload on receive of HUP signal for Linux 2.6
and other OSes.

fix for URL conversion: unicode characters < 0x20 and > 0x7f
are not manipulated.  So in arabic countries regular expressions
like google.*q=%d8%b3 can be used.

fixed small memory leak for users with time-constranied ACLs

removed compiler warnings on Solaris 9

ufdbUpdate always works with valid username and password.


Release 1.5  - December 7 2005

fixes for the installation procedure: 
install ufdbGuard.conf in correct directory (specified with --with-ufdb-config)
preserve old user-configuration values in ufdbUpdate
/etc/init.d/ufdb is updated with proper PATH for ufdbguardd binary

Release 1.32.2 - October 20, 2016

This release caused some major problems and is revoked.

Fix: when URL tables with parameters are used, ufdbGuard may not always find the URL in the URL table producing a false negative result
Change: the default DB format of ufdbGenTable changed to 2.2


Release 1.32.3 - October 21, 2016

Some changes of 1.32.2 are reversed since the intended solution did not work well 
for many users.  The issue remains that the database format "DB2.1" of ufdbGuard 1.32.x is
incompatible with "DB2.1" of ufdbGuard 1.31.x but it is highly unlikely that users notice 
this since ufdbGenTable of ufdbGuard 1.31.x uses DB2.0 as the default database format 
and hence does not cause issues.

Fix: URL tables with a parameter without value (e.g. example.com/cgi?foo=) caused a fatal error
Fix: when URL tables with parameters are used, ufdbGuard may not always find the URL in the URL table producing a false negative result
Change: the default DB format of ufdbGenTable changed to 2.2 and supports parameters in URLs
Change: ufdbGenTable: do not accept URLs with parameters for database format 2.1


Release 1.32.4 - December 13, 2016
