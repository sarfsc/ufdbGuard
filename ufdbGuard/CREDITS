The ufdbGuard Software Suite  http://www.urlfilterdb.com/products/ufdbguard.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In March 2005 ufdbGuard 1.0 was forked from squidGuard 1.2.  squidGuard is a 
free GPL2-based URL redirector for Squid which was written by Pål Baltzersen 
and Lars Erik Håland.

Since 2005 the development of ufdbGuard was done by the Dutch company 
URLfilterDB B.V.

Many users of ufdbGuard requested features to be implemented and we are
always grateful to receive feedback for new improvements.

In February 2015 Yuri Voinov contributed SMF files for Solaris 10.
